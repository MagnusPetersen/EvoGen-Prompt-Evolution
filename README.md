# EvoGen-Prompt-Evolution
![Evolved Prompt Output](/Media/banner.png "Evolved Prompt Output")
## Description & Method
EvoGen is an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes prompts for text-to-image models for aesthetics, as assessed by @rivershavewings aethetics model.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MagnusPetersen/EvoGen-Prompt-Evolution/blob/main/Notebook/EvoGen.ipynb)

The algorithm is composed of three different AI models, stable diffusion as the generative model, which generates images from prompts, @rivershavewings aesthetics model that rates the resulting images and the evolutionary algorithm that created the prompts at random and then optimizes the prompts based on the rating by using the highest rated prompts to generate the next generation of prompts.

## Usage
### Setup
To run this notebook or any Stablediffusion notebook you need to get the ckpt file of the model and put it on your Google Drive. It can be downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion).
### Hyperparameters
#### Evolutionary Algorithm Settings

General population settings, such as how many generations the algorithm runs for, how many prompts there are in each generation, and the word length range of the prompts.

* **generations:** How many generations the algorithm runs for

* **population_count:** How many prompts there are in each generation/how large each generation is

* **prompt_length_max:** Maximum prompt length when the population is initialized, during evolution this limit can be surpassed.

* **prompt_length_min:** Minimum prompt length when the population is initialized, during evolution this limit can be surpassed.

* **artist_prop:** Probability to sample from the artist list when adding or mutating a word.

* **genre_prop:** Probability to sample from the genre list when adding or mutating a word.

* **custom_prop:** Probability to sample from the custom user-defined list when adding or mutating a word.

The difference between the sum of the three custom lists and 1 is the probability to sample from the English dictionary word list.

* **delete_prop:** probability to delete a word per word in each prompt after each generation

* **add_prop:** probability to add a new word per word in each prompt after each generation from the word lists

* **mutate_prop:** probability to swap out a word per word in each prompt after each generation for a new word from the word lists

* **shuffle_prop:** The probability to shuffle the order of words per prompt

* **cross_prop:** The cross-over probability is the probability of the parents of the next generation swapping prompt parts per parent pair

* **k:** K denotes the rounds in the tournament selection process. A higher K value means fewer parents generate the next generation, this means a higher score increase but less diversity in the prompts.

* **cutoff:** Cutoff aesthetics score to save the image and prompt
#### Image Generation Settings
Image generation settings have an impact on the speed and behavior of the evolutionary algorithm, the euler_a sampler in conjunction with low step size and resolution is advisable for quick prompt evolution. Good prompts can then later be used to generate higher-quality images. The parameter n_samples determines how many images are generated per prompt, the scores are then averaged. A higher n_samples slows down the generation but stabilizes the optimization.

* **n_samples:** The number of samples/seeds that will be evaluated per prompt in each generation. A higher n_samples slows down the generation but stabilizes the optimization.

## To Do
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The hyperparameters are barely tuned and there is a lot of performance to be had when it comes to aesthetics optimization, prompt diversity, and optimization speed. 

* **Evolutionary Algorithm Tuning:** The algorithm is very basic and I have not read much on evolutionary algorithms. Here there is still a lot of room for improvement. Especially the crossover stage of the algorithm might be suboptimal the way it is done now for text.

* **General Features:** There are some features I would like to add, especially having a "base" prompt that is in each population member so that you can take your favorite prompt and build on it.
